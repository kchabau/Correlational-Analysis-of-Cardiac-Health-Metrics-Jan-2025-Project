# Abstract

The objective of this study is to analyze a dataset of **270,000 patients** with reported heart disease to identify correlations between various metrics and cardiac health. Through structured data analysis, key demographic and behavioral factors are investigated to uncover potential risk contributors. This research also serves as a illustration of practical application of SQL and data visualization techniques, advancing data analysis skills in the field of cardiovascular health.

This project is intended to follow up on my SQL learning and illustrate Advanced Analyzing Techniques as well as Data Visualization ability.

We receive this data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankushpanday1/heart-attack-in-china-youth-vs-adult) authored by Author Ankush Panday.

This dataset contains data representing the risk factors, demographics, and health behaviors related to heart attacks among youth and adults in China. (From when starting this project, the data set was last updated at approximately *7:00 AM Jan 6, 2025*). I began analyzing this dataset at approximately *12:00 AM Jan 7, 2025.*

The goal is to investigate demographic patterns, key metrics, and underlying factors influencing cardiovascular risk.
